# Decisions

Documentation outlining the major decisions and the rationale behind them.

## Next.js as the prototype React framework

Next.js was selected as the prototype react framework because I already use it to generate my static personal site. It will work well enough to show off progress quickly.

## Unit testing tool: vitest

Vitest was selected for "unit testing". This selection came down to next.js docs and overlap with Remix, which I'm currently using for other projects. (Note: in the future if we desire e2e testing we'll use playwright for the same reasoning.)
